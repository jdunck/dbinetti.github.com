<title>David Binetti - Founder, Votizen</title>
<body> 

<h2>David Binetti, Votizen CEO and Co-Founder USA.gov</h2> 
<img src='dbinetti.png' class="floatLeft"></img> 

<br><br><p>I've included some brief biographical information below, but please know this site isn't (just) an exercise in vanity;  I maintain it mostly to keep ahead of sites like Namyz, Spoke, etc., who are claiming identities (including mine) to support failed business models.  <!-- For current information and my professional perspective on Product Marketing for startups, please read my blog, <a href='http://www.rulesforstartups.blogspot.com'.>Rules for Startups</a>.  You can also download my <a href='/david_binetti_CV.pdf'>CV</a> if interested. --><br><br><br>

<img src='votizenlogo.png' align='right' width='200'></img>
My current project is <a href='http://www.votizen.com'>Votizen</a>, a social 
lobbying platform for registered voters.  Votizen helps citizens 
accomplish their civic duty in a social way â€” backed by the real-world power of 
their voting record. I am a 
near-religious adherent to 
the <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Startup">lean startup</a> philosophy, and am honored to have investors that include <a href='http://www.steveblank.com'>Steve Blank</a>, <a href='http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/about-dave-mcclure.html'>Dave McClure</a>, and <a href='http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/'>Eric Ries</a> guiding me along the way.  

<br><br><br>


<!-- <img src='arlogo.png' align='right' width='100'></img> 
<img src='senlogo.png' align='right' width='100'></img>
Prior to Votizen, I spent three years in the sensor-computing space as the first marketing hire at each of two closely related companies <a href='http://www.sentilla.com'>Sentilla</a> and <a href='http://www.archrock.com'>Arch Rock</a>.  Both companies have great people and great technology and are worth keeping an eye on.<br><br> -->

<img src='caplogo.png' align='right' width='150'></img> 
Before that I founded <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050125170726/http://capitolix.com/">Capitolix</a>, which was an ASP for political campaigns.  It was a spectacular failure as a financial investment but gosh did I learn.  I paid for those lessons with three years of my life, countless nights at the office and an ulcer.  But I am so much stronger for it, as Capitolix prompted my conversion to the lean approach.  <br><br><br>

<img src='POTUS.jpg' class="floatoo"></img>
<img src='usa.png' align='right' width='150'></img>
That was preceded by <a href='http://www.usa.gov'>USA.gov</a>, which I co-founded with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/">Eric
Brewer</a> and a great team at the <a href="http://www.gsa.gov">GSA</a>.  
USA.gov is the official US Goverment portal and remains one of the most useful sites on the Net.  Here's a picture with President Clinton in the Oval Office
following the launch.  
I was incredibly honored to be invited to the White House at all, let alone to meet the President in the Oval Office.  That said, everyone should know that I am registered as "Decline to State" because I no longer believe the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._10#Application'>partisan system</a> is in the best interest of our nation.
<br><br><br>


<img src='quickmint.png' align='right' width='200'></img>I started my career at <a href='http://www.intuit.com'>Intuit</a> where I absorbed the basics on Product Marketing.  It was great because I learned about traditional product marketing from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Intuit-Microsoft-Revolutionized-Industry/dp/1591391369">one of the best</a>, but I also learned about marketing for startups as part of the 7-person team that created <a href='http://www.quicken.com'>Quicken.com</a>.  I still remember trying to explain to a GM how someday everyone would manage their personal finance in Internet-based applications and not on desktop software.  Almost fifteen years later and <a href="http://about.intuit.com/about_intuit/press_room/press_release/articles/2009/IntuitCompletesAcquisitionofMint.com">they finally get it</a>!    
<br><br><br>

<img src='cal_mascot.gif' class='floatright'></img>

The rest is pretty boring, but essentially I worked for a bunch of startups as an independent consultant before (and during) business school at <a href='anderson.ucla.edu'>UCLA</a>.  And speaking of school, I can't neglect to mention the finest learning institution in the history of the world, the University of California at <a href='http://www.berkeley.edu'>Berkeley</a> (Go Bears!) where I went to undergrad.  I don't get back to Memorial Stadium for football games as often as I'd like, but when I'm there you'll find me in Section QQ, leading cheers.  <br><br><br>

<!-- <img src='vihlogo.png' align='right' width='150'></img>

My passion is singing, and I'm proud to be President of <a href='http://www.vihchorus.org'>Voices in Harmony</a>, a Men's Chorus that performs out of San Jose.  We have a spectacular Musical Director, Dr. Greg Lyne, who is world-renowned for his master classes at the St. Petersburg Conservatory in Russia.  He's conducted the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, for cripe's sake!  And we have him as our full-time Director.  So amazing...<br><br>
-->


Last on the list, but first in my life, is my wonderful family.  I have a gorgeous and talented wife, an amazing daughter, incredibly supportive and loving parents, a brother and sister who are equally incredible, and in-laws that I adore.  I couldn't possibly be more more blessed.<br><br><br>

Sorry to bore you to death; hopefully that's enough to keep the <a href='http://www.namyz.com'>'extortionists-masquerading-as-networking-sites' </a> at bay....
